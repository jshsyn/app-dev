# :boom:My favorite anime series - *KONOSUBA: God's blessing on this wonderful world!*

![this is konosuba image](konosubs.jpg "animeseriespic")

> ***KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!*** is a Japanese light novel series written by [Natsume Akatsuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsume_Akatsuki). Konosuba is an anime that uses traditional anime archetypes to poke fun at specific genres. The story is simple, otaku boy dies and gets transported to another world where he finds himself surrounded by attractive females. The format of the show is similar to an RPG game where each character takes up roles like the healer, fighter and others. However, the setting is where these repetitive elements end. The anime takes on many twists and turns and has a high comedic quotient, making it stand out among others of the same genre.

  <summary><b>Characters</b></summary>
  <p>
          The characters are what make Konosuba really special. None of the characters is extremely powerful or overpowered. Even as a group, they have many limitations and are not the greatest. They have flaws that hold them back, and sometimes, arrogance gets the better of them. Despite the flaws, they eventually accept each other and drive the show towards a satisfying ending.
